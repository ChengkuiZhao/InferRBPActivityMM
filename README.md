# InferRBPActivityMM
Development of RNA-binding proteins activity inferring model for multiple myeloma risk prediction
## Introduction
We developed a pipeline to infer the RBP activity for specific diseases and further utilize the machine learning model to predict the disease risk. MM patients from MMRF and GEO datasets were collected to train and validate the methodology.
## Requirement
* R 4.0.2
* Survival
* Random Survival Forest
* MMRF
* TCGA
## Getting started
1. Prepare the requirement in your local computer
2. Download the method code and data you want to apply in the Github
3. Run the code step by step
## Note
* The Gene expression file of the MMRF used in GSEA analysis is too large for the Githubm you can down load from
